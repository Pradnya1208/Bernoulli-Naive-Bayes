## Overview:
Naïve Bayes classification is a straightforward and powerful algorithm for the classification task. Naïve Bayes classification is based on applying Bayes’ theorem with strong independence assumption between the features. Naïve Bayes classification produces good results when we use it for textual data analysis such as Natural Language Processing.

Naïve Bayes models are also known as simple Bayes or independent Bayes. All these names refer to the application of Bayes’ theorem in the classifier’s decision rule. Naïve Bayes classifier applies the Bayes’ theorem in practice. This classifier brings the power of Bayes’ theorem to machine learning.

#### Naive Bayes algorithm intuition:
Naïve Bayes Classifier uses the Bayes’ theorem to predict membership probabilities for each class such as the probability that given record or data point belongs to a particular class. The class with the highest probability is considered as the most likely class. This is also known as the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP).

The MAP for a hypothesis with 2 events A and B is

```
MAP (A)
= max (P (A | B))
= max (P (B | A) * P (A))/P (B)
= max (P (B | A) * P (A))
```

Here, P (B) is evidence probability. It is used to normalize the result. It remains the same, So, removing it would not affect the result.
<br>
Naïve Bayes Classifier assumes that all the features are unrelated to each other. Presence or absence of a feature does not influence the presence or absence of any other feature.

In real world datasets, we test a hypothesis given multiple evidence on features. So, the calculations become quite complicated. To simplify the work, the feature independence approach is used to uncouple multiple evidence and treat each as an independent one.

#### Types of Naïve Bayes algorithm:
The 3 types are listed below:-
- Gaussian Naïve Bayes
- Multinomial Naïve Bayes
- Bernoulli Naïve Bayes

#### Applications of Naive Bayes:
Naïve Bayes is one of the most straightforward and fast classification algorithm. It is very well suited for large volume of data. It is successfully used in various applications such as :
- Spam filtering
- Text classification
- Sentiment analysis
- Recommender systems
